# Garden_Lights_on_off_2pirs1.0
ESP8266 Multiple Switch ON OFF control with Alexa via 4 relay module. The relay module controls 3 different sets of LED lights and an electro valve to water the plants in the garden. Added motion detection with 2 PIRs located in different rooms and analog light intensity measurement with a photoresistor to trigger the relays that control the lights ON/OFF when a person enters/leaves a room.
